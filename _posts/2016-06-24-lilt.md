<p class="wow fadeInUp chat bl" data-wow-offset="60"><span><b>BL:</b> hows your day</span></p>
<p class="wow fadeInUp chat" data-wow-offset="60"><span><b>Me:</b> big things in the works... I proposed an idea for a game to my bro and one of his developer friends, and they love it.</span></p>
<p class="wow fadeInUp chat bl" data-wow-offset="60"><span>hahahahahahaha</span></p>
<p class="wow fadeInUp chat bl" data-wow-offset="60"><span>NICe</span></p>
<p class="wow fadeInUp chat bl" data-wow-offset="60"><span>about dang time</span></p>
<p class="wow fadeInUp chat bl" data-wow-offset="60"><span>what was it?</span></p>
<p class="wow fadeInUp chat" data-wow-offset="60"><span>a Twitter text adventure</span></p>
<p class="wow fadeInUp chat bl" data-wow-offset="60"><span>haha</span></p>
<p class="wow fadeInUp chat bl" data-wow-offset="60"><span>how wold that work?</span></p>
<p class="wow fadeInUp chat" data-wow-offset="60"><span>You're going to love it... basically, I created an account for it, and all you do is tweet "start" to the account, then it replies with the setting and some options - then you respond with what you want to do, and the game continues from there.</span></p>
<p class="wow fadeInUp chat" data-wow-offset="60"><span>And it'll all be programmed in with a Twitter bot using APIs</span></p>
<p class="wow fadeInUp chat" data-wow-offset="60"><span>And I'm going to do illustrations for different parts of the game, etc...</span></p>
<p class="wow fadeInUp chat" data-wow-offset="60"><span>basically, combines a bunch of stuff I'm interested in - tech/social media/gaming/illustration</span></p>
<p class="wow fadeInUp chat" data-wow-offset="60"><span>So, for example, the Twitter account for the game could reply "@mknepprath You're in a dark room. There is a door to your right and a table to your left. What will you do?"</span></p>
<p class="wow fadeInUp chat bl" data-wow-offset="60"><span>oooooooh</span></p>
<p class="wow fadeInUp chat bl" data-wow-offset="60"><span>so it's like an old text based game</span></p>
<p class="wow fadeInUp chat bl" data-wow-offset="60"><span>only via twitter</span></p>
<p class="wow fadeInUp chat" data-wow-offset="60"><span>Exactly</span></p>

[Lilt](http://twitter.com/familiarlilt) is a form of interactive fiction - a text adventure game you play through Twitter. Since thinking up the idea in 2014, I've gained enough knowledge of JavaScript, Python, PostgreSQL, and more to build out this game myself. I documented the development process, you can check out the series below.

## [Creating Lilt–Part 1](https://medium.com/@mknepprath/creating-lilt-part-1-2e0d1f699676#.r5cnanub4)
> Roughly one year ago, I had an idea for a game that would be entirely playable through Twitter. I don’t recall what sparked it, but the game would be a text adventure where you’d tweet to the game’s Twitter account, and it would respond with options for your next move. There are a few reasons I thought (and still believe) Twitter would be the perfect platform for this… [Read More](https://medium.com/@mknepprath/creating-lilt-part-1-2e0d1f699676#.r5cnanub4)

## [Creating Lilt–Part 2](https://medium.com/@mknepprath/creating-lilt-part-2-c5f8c5d391ab#.kw3j2av7c)
> Now that I’ve been working on this game for a month or so, it’s time to share some of my progress. I knew that writing the story for this game was going to be a challenge, but I had not realized that I’d first have to overcome a equally challenging prerequisite — figuring out how to write this story.

> Work has begun on a prototype of Lilt, and I thought it’d be fun to go through the steps I’ve taken to build it out so far. Disclaimer, if you want to play the game spoiler-free… don’t read this, but do hit me up on Twitter. Let’s jump in!

> As you may have seen in the addendum to Part 3, I had quite the wrench thrown into this project. One of the main tools I had become heavily invested in, Parse, announced that they’d be shutting down in early 2017.
