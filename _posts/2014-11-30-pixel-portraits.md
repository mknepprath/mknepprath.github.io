I was commissioned a few years ago to create a slew of pixel portraits based on influential people and characters.

A similar piece was displayed in the mid-year student art show. For the end-of-year student art show I decided to go even bigger. I illustrated a portrait of myself and followed the same process, except this time the piece ended up being 323 sheets of paper, or 12' x 17.5'. I was on a lift for a full day hanging it up. For comparison, you can see some normal artwork at the bottom of the second photo.
