> Michael was a joy to work with from our first meeting to final edit. I had strong ideas about what i wanted and he made things happen while also offering his professional opinion on some of my not so good ideas. I asked him to do things that he wasn't sure was possible with the template I selected for my website, but he did the necessary research and went above and beyond to give me what i asked for. He also helped me make the launch of my site a success by submitting my info to local's searches for the major search engines and setting up a facebook and twitter page for my company. He had many suggestions on how to best get my name out there via these applications as well as SEO and was always willing to help out with questions i had after the job was finished. 
> His level of service, promptness and service after sale were all very impressive and i would recommend him to anyone. I feel that i got a very good value with great results for the amount of work he put in As long as Michael is around i will have no need for a new web- designer, so step back, ya'll!
