[Smith Lawn and Landscape](http://smithlawn.net/) is a local full-service residential and commercial landscaping, lawn care and snow removal company. The owner approached me a couple years ago about redesigning his site which had become [a bit long in the tooth](/images/smithlawn-old.png). We decided that this would be a great opportunity to solve some problems - lack of mobile support, inability to display work well, lack of contact form, and more.

The next couple months were spent experimenting with different ideas and emailing each comments we had about where to go with the website, such as, "Maybe the leaf from my logo would work as the 'bullet'," or, "Can we change the background images? I rarely do sod work so not sure its best for my home screen :)" We went back and forth on quite a few details, but landed on something we both approved of for each one. One example - I wanted the top menu to stay hidden until the user hit "Get Started" so that they'd have a very focused point of interaction. This was ditched in favor of having the Contact link immediately available for those who didn't want to browse.

On top of designing and developing the website, I also set up a business email, [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/SmithLawnLandscape), [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/smithlawn), and submitted Smith Lawn's business information to all of the major listing services online. I also offered some consultation on keeping those accounts and their blog updated (which automatically posts to their accounts using [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/).

The owner was kind enough to recommend my work - you can view his comments below. Thanks, Jordan!

> Michael was a joy to work with from our first meeting to final edit. I had strong ideas about what I wanted and he made things happen, while also offering his professional opinion on some of my not so good ideas. I asked him to do things that he wasn't sure was possible with the template I selected for my website, but he did the necessary research and went above and beyond to give me what I asked for. He also helped me make the launch of my site a success by submitting my info to local searches for the major search engines and setting up a Facebook and Twitter page for my company. He had many suggestions on how to best get my name out there via these applications as well as SEO and was always willing to help out with questions I had after the job was finished. 
> His level of service, promptness and service after sale were all very impressive and I would recommend him to anyone. I feel that I got a very good value with great results for the amount of work he put in. As long as Michael is around I will have no need for a new web designer, so step back, ya'll!
