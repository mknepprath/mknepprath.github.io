I've had a long-standing theory that when Disney acquired Pixar, they began to suck the talent out of Pixar into their own animation studio - culminating in the critical flop that was Cars 2. My theory doesn't hold up, considering Cars, Ratatouille, Wall-E, Up, and Toy Story 3 were all released after the acquisition in 2006, but I thought it'd be interesting to chart these films in a variety of ways regardless. Turns out, Disney Animation Studios had been turning out fairly well-reviewed movies long before Cars 2 - and even the likes of Wreck-It Ralph and Frozen didn't fair much better than their previous releases.

On the other hand, Frozen was the first Disney film to surpass Pixar's counterpart that year, Monsters University, in the box office. So... we'll see what happens!
