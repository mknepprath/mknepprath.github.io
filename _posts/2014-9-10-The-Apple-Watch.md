title: The Apple Watch
---

The [Watch](http://www.apple.com/watch/design/) is here, and it's comical to see [history repeat itself once again](http://venturebeat.com/2014/09/09/apple-watch-is-ugly-and-boring-and-steve-jobs-would-have-agreed/)([iPhone](http://adage.com/article/al-ries/iphone-fail/117355/), [iPad](http://www.infoworld.com/d/windows/why-apples-rumored-itablet-will-fail-big-time-119)). The media cycle has become predictable when it comes to an Apple product launch: hype, hype, HYPE, disappointment, acceptance (once it becomes clear that consumers love it).

Apple's competitors have been working very hard to make a cool wrist gadget - fashion being an afterthought. My main takeaway from this event is that Apple has clearly been studying a great deal about how things work in the watch industry, addressing fashion first - because they've learned that regular people aren't going to stick a big, ugly computer on their wrist no matter how many superpowers it grants them.

I think the Watch is going to be a success in time, especially as it gets thinner over the next few generations.
