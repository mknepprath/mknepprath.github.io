## The Engagement
This is a pixel reenactment of my proposal to my wife created entirely in Photoshop as a project for one of my animation classes.

## Black Hole Face Man Loses His Tea
Oh, bother. This hand-drawn frame-by-frame animation required nearly 200 drawings for only 8 seconds of footage.

## Mankato Marathon Introduction
This was created pro bono as an introduction for the [Mankato Marathon](http://mankatomarathon.com/)'s promotional videos and was used for many years. The animation had to transition cleanly into the the already-designed logo.

## Ben and Mike at Formal
Ben and Mike at Formal was played at the beginning of a formal dance and ended up being the most awkward two minutes of all of our lives. Enjoy!

## MAKEUP
My wife donated her time and face to this stop-motion animation about the horrors of out-of-control makeup.

## Ethan's Rap
This acapella song was serendipitously captured on my phone one evening with no intention behind it. It ended up being the perfect animation companion, as you can see below.
