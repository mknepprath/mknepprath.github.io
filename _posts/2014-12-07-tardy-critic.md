The following tweet quickly sparked [Tardy Critic](http://www.tardycritic.com/), a site where films are reviewed ten years after their original release date.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>I&#39;d love a film critic site that only reviewed films from a decade before, detached from all the promotion and hype.</p>&mdash; Michael Knepprath (@mknepprath) <a href="https://twitter.com/mknepprath/status/453925343322071042">April 9, 2014</a></blockquote>

You can view the conversation that ensued on Tardy Critic's [About page](http://tardycritic.com/about/). I'm not sure what film set me off, but I was getting tired of Hollywood's hype machine. Hundreds of millions of dollars are being spent on marketing for films today, and I had a sneaking suspicion that this money/hype cycle was unfairly skewing critics' perception of films upon their release.

So, what better way to escape this cycle than to review films long after their release? It's been over ten years since Ocean's Twelve, Kung Fu Hustle, and Shaun of the Dead came out - we can now review these films without the millions of dollars worth or marketing being pushed on us with the sole purpose of making us like them.

A great team rallied around this idea right from the start, and I'll admit that nothing would have come of this without their excitement and contributions, so I'd like to send a big "Thank you!" out to [@MrBobDobolina](http://twitter.com/mrbobdobolina), [@commonfrequency](http://twitter.com/commonfrequency), [@SomeCallMeJonas](http://twitter.com/somecallmejonas), and [@aaronmievans](http://twitter.com/aaronmievans) for getting this idea off the ground.
