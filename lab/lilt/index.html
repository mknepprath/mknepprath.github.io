  <li>start
    <ul>You are resting in a glade. There is a waterfall to your right and a pathway to your left. What will you do?
      <li>walk down the path | walk down the pathway | take the path | walk the path
        <ul>You walk down the path but soon realize your way is blocked by a large felled tree. You walk back.
          <li>pick up the ladle
            <ul>You now have a #ladle.
            </ul></li></ul></li>
      <li>look at the waterfall
        <ul>The water looks pure. There are beautiful koi fish swimming around in it.
        </ul></li>
      <li>drink from the waterfall
        <ul>Something prevents you from touching the water with your hands. Perhaps you need a tool for that?
        </ul>
        <ul>(#ladle) You use the ladle to scoop up some water and drink it. You are now immortal.
